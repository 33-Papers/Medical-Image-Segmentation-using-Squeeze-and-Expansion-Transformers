# Medical Image Segmentation using Squeeze-and-Expansion Transformers

This repository contains code for replicating the results of the paper titled "Medical Image Segmentation Using Squeeze-and-Expansion Transformers" ([Link to Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09511)).

## Introduction

Medical image segmentation is a critical task in the field of healthcare and medical research. The Squeeze-and-Expansion Transformers (Segtran) is a novel approach proposed in the paper for medical image segmentation. This repository provides the necessary code to replicate the results and experiment with the Segtran architecture.
